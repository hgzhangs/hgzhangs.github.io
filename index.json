However, fragmented and scattered rice paddies due to undulating and varied topography, and the availability and quality of remote sensing images (e.g., frequent cloud coverage) pose significant challenges to accurate long-term rice mapping, especially for traditional pixel and phenological methods in subtropical monsoon regions. This study proposed a superpixel and deep-learning-based time series method to analyze Landsat time series data for paddy rice classification in complex landscape regions. First, a superpixel segmentation map was generated using a dynamic-time-warping-based simple non-iterative clustering algorithm with preprocessed spectral indices (SIs) time series data. Second, the SI images were overlaid onto the superpixel map to construct mean SIs time series for each superpixel. Third, a multivariate long short-term memory full convolution neural network (MLSTM-FCN) classifier was employed to learn time series features of rice paddies to produce accurate paddy rice maps. The method was evaluated using Landsat imagery from 2000 to 2020 in Cengong County, Guizhou Province, China. Results indicate that the superpixel MLSTM-FCN achieved a high performance with an overall accuracy varying from 0.9547 to 0.9721, which presents an 0.17‚Äì1.23% improvement compared to the random forest method. This study showed that combining spectral, spatial, and temporal features with deep learning methods can generate accurate paddy rice maps in complex landscape regions","tags":["Planthopper; spatial and temporal patterns"],"title":"Mapping paddy rice in complex landscapes with Landsat time series data and superpixel-based deep learning method","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongguo Zhang","Binbin He","Jin Xing","Minghong Lu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1644537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644537600,"objectID":"6c9ebf9bd6b44c8e520d2e683c1f2af8","permalink":"https://hgzhangs.github.io/publication/article_rph_pattern/","publishdate":"2022-02-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article_rph_pattern/","section":"publication","summary":"Rice planthoppers (RPH) are important pest that cause severe yield losses of rice production in China. South and Southwest China are the main infestation areas on the annual spread of RPH. Identifying the spatial and temporal patterns in migration and subsequent development can provide insight into underlying mechanisms driving the spread of RPH and assist governments with prioritizing areas to achieve proactive management and prevention. Across rice production regions in South and Southwest China, RPH population were recorded by light traps and field surveys at 195 counties from March to October in 2000 to 2019. We first measured the spatial patterns in RPH immigrant populations and field populations with spatial autocorrelation analysis. Then, spatial hotspot analysis was undertaken to highlight dense RPH regions, and significant hot spots were further extracted for comparing the spatial and temporal patterns according to RPH species. The results revealed that RPH population were highly aggregated in space over large geographical distances up to 700 km approximately. Geographic patterns and hot spots of populations varied substantially with time and species, and various spatial patterns might be determined by inherent properties of RPH and rice eco-systematic. Overall, these results provided essential information to improving and optimizing the monitoring network for RPH. The findings from this research may provide helpful information to enhance proactive management against RPH and offer sustainable management practitioners new opportunities to design, develop, and implement optimal pest control strategies to protect rice production in China.","tags":["Planthopper; spatial and temporal patterns"],"title":"Spatial and temporal patterns of rice planthopper populations in South and Southwest China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["An Gangqiang","Xing Minfeng","He Binbin","Kang Haiqi","Shang Jiali","Liao Chunhua","Huang Xiaodong","Hongguo Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1628640000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628640000,"objectID":"1f8bfffa3a6719cc87d0c43d7de3a00d","permalink":"https://hgzhangs.github.io/publication/an_rs_2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/an_rs_2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Rice false smut (RFS), caused by Ustilaginoidea virens, is a significant grain disease in rice that can lead to reduced yield and quality.

In this study, we used the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm to comprehensively understand the urban expansion processes in Tianjin based on the Landsat Time Series (LTS) from 1985 to 2018 with 30-meter resolution. Specially, we applied the c-factor approach with the RossThick-LiSparse-R model to correct the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) effect for each Landsat image and calculated a spatial line-density feature for improving the change detection and the classification. Based on the study in Tianjin, we found that BRDF correction can substantially improve the change detection (9.00% higher overall accuracy) and classification (1.08% higher overall accuracy); and the line-density is also beneficial to classification (0.48% higher overall accuracy), especially for impervious surface (1.70% less commission errors and 1.49% less omission errors).

Historically, images obtained from sun-orbiting satellites such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to detect active fire and burned area at the large spatial scale. However, the daily revisit cycles make them inherently unable to extract FSR in near real¬≠-time (hourly or less). We argue that the Himawari-8, a next generation geostationary satellite with a 10-min temporal resolution and 0.5‚Äì2 km spatial resolution, may have the potential for near real-time FSR extraction. To that end, we propose a novel method (named H8-FSR) for near real-time FSR extraction based on the Himawari-8 data. The method first defines the centroid of the burned area as the fire center and then the near real-time FSR is extracted by timely computing the movement rate of the fire center. As a case study, the method was applied to the Esperance bushfire that broke out on 17 November, 2015, in Western Australia. Compared with the estimated FSR using the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Grassland Fire Spread (GFS) model, H8-FSR achieved favorable performance with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.54, mean bias error of ‚Äì0.75 m/s, mean absolute percent error of 33.20% and root mean square error of 1.17 m/s, respectively. These results demonstrated that the Himawari-8 data are valuable for near real-time FSR extraction, and also suggested that the proposed method could be potentially applicable to other next generation geostationary satellite data.","tags":["FSR","Himawari-8"],"title":"Near Real-Time Extracting Wildfire Spread Rate from Himawari-8 Satellite Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
